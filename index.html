    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>

    <img id="image" src="assets/images/photo.jpg" alt="Ying Huang"/>

    <p1 class="text1"> My name is Ying Huang, I'm 26 years old and born in China. I moved to the US when I was 6 years old about to turn 7. I lived in Philadelphia ever since I moved to the US. I am an only child but grew up surrounded by many cousins, these cousins would be the equivalent of siblings to me as if they were brothers and sisters.

    <br></br>

    <p2 class="text2"> I graduated from Central High school and continued my education at Penn State University. My major at the beginning of college was mechcanical engineering, however by the time I graduated I ended up with a degree in Asian Studies.</p2>

    <br></br>

    <p3 class="text3"> My hobbies include playing games, tennis, and baking. My prefer genre of games would be RPG. I first started playing tennis in high school and continue to do so now on a 4.0 tennis team. The best baked dessert I am at making are Japanese cheesecakes, also called cotton cheesecakes.</p3>
